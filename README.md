As a Science-Teacher-Turned-Web-Developer, I love finding simple & elegant solutions to difficult problems and my passion for constant learning has kept me driven to stay on top of the ever-changing world of web technologies. Whenever possible, I love giving back to the open-source technologies that make my work possible and the FOSS community at-large.
